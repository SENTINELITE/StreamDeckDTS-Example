 In order to correctly test this, you'll need Elgato's StreamDeck software installed on the device. There's a mobile app with a free 1 week trial, which can be used to debug this.
 
 Setup Instructions:
 â€¢ Download this project, & build it.
 â€¢ Mac StreamDeck Software: https://edge.elgato.com/egc/macos/sd/Stream_Deck_5.2.1.15025.pkg  Alt Link: https://www.elgato.com/en/downloads
 â€¢ iOS/iPadOS App Store Link: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/elgato-stream-deck-mobile/id1440014184
 â€¢ After building this package, under the derived data folder, run the following command to generate the StreamDeck Plugin's folder structure
 â€¢ Download the example shortcut (it's hardcoded, but you may change it) located here: https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/7b67ea37a8c64e4bad7824925cdc41bd

 After installing it all, quit & restart the StreamDeck Software, to boot up our new plugin.
 
 Open the Console.app & search for the process: `shortcut-plugin`, monitor the logs & push one of the key's to see the error...
